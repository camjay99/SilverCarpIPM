This repository contains the code used in Coles et al. (submitted), including code for all figures, data used, and the modified MetaIPM code.

## MetaIPM
In this project, we created a modified version of the [MetaIPM project](https://code.usgs.gov/umesc/quant-ecology/metaipm/-/tree/v2.0) that includes density-dependent growth and length-based egg production and survival.
